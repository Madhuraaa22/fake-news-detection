# 📰 Fake News Detection using Logistic Regression

## 🚀 Overview
This is a simple yet effective **Fake News Detection System** built using **Python**, **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, and **Machine Learning**.  
The system classifies news headlines as either **Real News** ✅ or **Fake News** ❌ based on textual features.

✅ Built with beginner-friendly tools  
✅ Fast and lightweight  
✅ Ready for extension with advanced models or web deployment

## 📂 Dataset
- Uses **Fake.csv** (from Kaggle's Fake and Real News Dataset) for fake news examples.
- Manually created **real news headlines** for a balanced demonstration.


## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **Scikit-learn** (TF-IDF Vectorizer & Logistic Regression)
